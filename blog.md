# DCGANs for image super-resolution, denoising and debluring
Dan Sochirca, Petter Reijalt

In this blogpost we emulate the findings in the paper DCGANs for image super-resolution, denoising and debluring [^1]. We sought to improve on the suggested architecture by introducing by leveraging self-attention.
