# DCGANs for image super-resolution, denoising and deblurring
Dan Sochirca, Petter Reijalt

In this blog post, we emulate the findings in the paper DCGANs for image super-resolution, denoising and deblurring [^1]. We sought to improve on the suggested architecture by introducing and leveraging self-attention. 

## Introduction
Increased computational power and the advent of bigger datasets have improved the ability of deep learning methods to do image processing. Generative adversarial networks have been used in conjunction with deep learning methods in order to create realistic images and fill up gaps in missing data. Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGANs), have been used to great success to build good image representation). It bridges the gap beteen GANs and CNNs.
